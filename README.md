Random Laugh Access

Twilio-based project started by lou suSi for Laugh Institute

I began writing the code for this at Tufts Hackathon 2013 but could not successfully get the functionality to work due to my lack of knowledge with PHP and other major scripting languages

I managed to throw together an HTML and Javascript low fidelity prototype of what should happen when someone calls the Twilio number to the Laugh Hotline â€” just click on rla.htm to see what should happen, which is dead simple

More info and development on this soon
